Introduction to SWQAT

The Overall Index of Pollution (OIP) is a single number that expresses the overall water quality 
by integrating measurements of fourteen different physicochemical, toxicological, and bacteriological 
water quality parameters. It provides a simple and concise method for water quality classification as, 
‘Excellent’, ‘Acceptable’, ‘Slightly Polluted’, ‘Polluted’, and ‘Heavily Polluted’. A computer-automated 
tool SWQAT has been developed to generate and operate on OIP. The software is developed in VB.Net and 
SQL database. An open source Google Earth plug-in is integrated with the software for online display of 
OIP values on Google map.

SWQAT comprise of three modules, namely- Input module, OIP calculation module and Visual interpretation module.
The applicability of the software is demonstrated through case study of two rivers of India. OIP values for ten 
sampling locations on the river Cauvery and eight sampling locations on the river Tungabhadra computed using SWQAT. 
Software generated kml files of Cauvery and Tungabhadra river is attached with the document. 
The kml file contains locations of sampling points of Cauvery and Tungabhadra rivers with Overall Index of Pollution 
values and Water Quality Classification at particular sampling station. Please follow following steps to run given 
the kml file:

1.  Download the Google Earth Plug-in from below link
url: http://www.google.com/earth/explore/products/plugin.html
2.	Install the Google Earth Plug-in on local PC.
3.	Download the Cauvery and Tungabhadra.kmz on local PC 
4.	Locate kmz file on your system and double click the kmz file to run it.
5.	Click on any sampling station to know the water quality at that sampling station

Note: The software is capable of generating such kml file for any surface water body and 
locate the sampling station when longitude and latitude information is provided.
